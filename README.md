In this folder you find a wide range of programming exercises that were completed while working through the *core curriculum* of the learning platform **freeCodeCamp**. It has been qualified by its authors as a "full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum", so that its focus is logically to be found in these areas of programming.  
For further information you may want to have a look at their website [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn:] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) or their GitHub presence [https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/:] (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp).  

In detail, freeCodeCamp's *core curriculum* includes the following courses:  
* Responsive Web Design Certification,
* JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification,
* Front End Development Libraries Certification,
* Data Visualization Certification,
* Relational Database Certification,
* Back End Development and APIs Certification,
* Quality Assurance Certification,
* Scientific Computing with Python Certification,
* Data Analysis with Python Certification,
* Information Security Certification,
* Machine Learning with Python Certification,
* College Algebra with Python Certification.  

In accordance with fCC forum practice (and that is, for didactic reasons), solutions to the *interactive coding lessons* (or *coding challenges*) are not (re-)published here. This repository only contains code for the final *projects* that had to be done independently by every course participant.
