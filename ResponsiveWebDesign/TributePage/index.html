        <p id="tribute-info-p1" class="tribute-paragraph">
          This website is dedicated to the memory of <strong>Giuseppe Moscati</strong>, a highly-esteemed physician and scientist from Southern Italy and at the same time a devoted Catholic, who due to his success in treatment and his efforts especially for the most vulnerable and the destitute among his patients has been venerated like a saint since his lifetime. In fact, his veneration did not remain limited to his contemporaries or his homeland: His fame spread quickly far beyond his place of work and has been preserved over several generations, his medical combined with his pastoral commitment have been honored both by secular and by religious institutions. 60 years after his death, Moscati has even been elevated to the ranks of the official saints of the Catholic Church. As a result, right up to the present day a number of believers visit his tomb within the <i>Chapel of the Visitation</i> in the Jesuit church Gesù Nuovo in Naples and offer their prayers (and, occasionally, a votive gift).
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p2" class="tribute-paragraph">
          For all we know, Moscati must have been an extraordinary person in many respects. Sure enough, he benefited from particularly favourable starting conditions: He grew up well protected in a caring family, he spent a cheerful childhood without experiencing material hardship, he was given the opportunity to develop his talents, received an excellent education and was overall successfully socialised. And yet he did not simply follow the tracks laid out for him, but carved out his very own path in life.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p3" class="tribute-paragraph">
          Early on he decided, against his father's expectations, to study medicine rather than law and to pursue a career as a doctor. A keen sense for the suffering in the world, experiences in his family environment and observations in the nearby "Hospital of the Incurables" – his later place of work – are likely to have contributed to this choice, as did his rather practical religiousness (inspired, among others, by St. Francis). Moscati was firmly convinced that he could also save his patients' souls through a holistic, people-centered, empathetic form of treatment – and, if needed, reconcile them with God. And he had all the skills and qualities required for this task.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p4" class="tribute-paragraph">
          He not only possessed the necessary technical expertise (which even his enviers and competitors did not dispute), but also a high degree of self-control, of discipline and of willingness to work hard – and to persevere. Moreover, he must have been a good observer and attentive listener, who understood well what was actually going on around him and what people were trying to tell him (or withhold from him). Contemporaries have attested to his exceptional ability to grasp things and to recognise connections, which allowed him to precisely diagnose diseases sometimes even with very incomplete information.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p5" class="tribute-paragraph">
          When dealing with his patients, Moscati stood out due to his humanity, his affability, his empathy and his charity, coupled with personal frugality and modesty. As can be seen from a number of his statements, he was prepared to give everything for the well-being and, as he hoped, the salvation of the people entrusted to him. Consequently, he even waived the charges for those indigent and unable to look after themselves and paid for their medication and food out of his own pocket – an engagement that earned him the nickname "doctor of the poor". In accordance with his view of the profession, he did not only provide medical care and issue prescriptions, but also acted as an advocate, a counsellor, a pastor of his patients.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p6" class="tribute-paragraph">
          Moscati's Christian stance as a physician, as expressed in this professional ethos, may be seen as another defining aspect of his individual path in life. The man retained his firm faith even in an environment rather critical of religion and notably of traditional Catholicism, working among naturalists, materialists and freemasons alike, whose presence significantly characterised the atmosphere both at the university and at his hospital. For Moscati, who has repeatedly commented on the issue, there was no unbridgeable conflict between religion and science, between the teachings of the Christian faith and the findings of modern scholarship. On the contrary, he saw his own scientific work as an excellent opportunity to serve his fellow men as well as the will of God and, in the final analysis, to rise intellectually to his Creator.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p7" class="tribute-paragraph">
          As far as his working environment is concerned, Moscati also endured with equanimity the favouritism and clientelism that he encountered on various occasions mainly in the academic world. And what is more: throughout his life he did never allow himself to be discouraged by setbacks or injustices in the long term, but proved to be amazingly resilient and determined to the end.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p8" class="tribute-paragraph">
          Of course, at the end of the day he was only a human, with his individual peculiarities and shortcomings. Moscati was an extremely conservative mind, to whom quite a few of the social and cultural developments of the modern age remained alien (to say the least). He maintained his own strict moral standards and, therefore, took offence at the deviating behaviour of his fellow citizens. Living in Naples not only confronted him day after day with hardship and misery and social tensions, the city also enjoyed a dubious reputation as a „cesspool of sin“ – and, thus, regularly challenged a man of his convictions. Moreover, he was used to placing the highest demands on himself, but, by doing so, also put his supporters and his relatives under pressure to act, who seem to have made great sacrifices for his sake.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info-p9" class="tribute-paragraph">
          In short, despite all his positive character traits (as outlined above), he probably was not always an easy person to get along with: an oftentimes overly serious man, a restless workaholic, an idealist who – deep down – expected a great deal from his contemporaries. And yet, his way of practising the medical profession, his inexhaustible commitment to his fellow human beings and his dedication to his self-chosen mission in life may (alongside his unshakeable trust in God) still inspire people today.
        </p>

[…] Moscati provides an example not only to be admired, but to be imitated, especially by health care workers. […] He sets himself as an example even for those who do not share his faith. 
However, it was precisely this faith that gave his commitment new dimensions and qualities, those typical of the authentically Christian layman. Thanks to them, the professional aspects, in his life, harmoniously complemented each other, supported each other, to be lived as a response to a vocation, and thus as a collaboration to God's creative and redemptive plan. [...] <br/>
Mindful of the Lord's words, 'I was sick and you visited me' (Mt 25:36), Moscati saw Christ himself in the sick person, who, in his weakness, his misery, his frailty and insecurity, turned to him calling for help; he saw the one facing him as a person, a being in whom there was a body in need of care, but also a being in whom dwelt a spirit likewise in need of help and comfort."</p>
