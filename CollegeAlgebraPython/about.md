# College Algebra with Python  
s. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/college-algebra-with-python/  

This course is designed as a one-semester college course. It consists of instructional videos, with Google Colaboratory notebooks to follow along interactively, assignments, and challenging projects.  
As you go through each part of this course in sequence, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve Algebra problems.  
Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra Colab notebook that you will be able to use as your custom calculator. This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for a deeper math and data science understanding.  

## COURSES  

### Learn Ratios and Proportions  
Your journey begins here as you learn how to set up a Colab Notebook that can run Python code. Then, use the notebook to follow along with the videos to learn ratios and proportions using Python.

### Learn Quadratic Equations  
This unit will go beyond linear equations, to work with exponents and graph parabolas. You will learn how to find key points in parabolas and how to solve quadratic equations.  
* Quadratics

### PROJECT 2: Graphing Calculator
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.  
For this project, you will build a graphing calculator.  

### Learn Parent Graphs and Polynomials  
This unit will show you many different types of "parent" graphs, the basic patterns that make up more complicated graphs. Polynomials are mathematical expressions with "multiple things" - the more complicated equations that are built with basic patterns. You will see what these graphs look like, how to modify them, and how to do this all with Python code.  
* Parent Graphs
* Parent Graphs and Polynomials: Extra  

### PROJECT 3: Three Math Games
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.  
For this project, you will build three math games.  

### Learn Business Applications of College Algebra  
This unit will show you how to apply your solving and graphing skills to find cost, revenue, and profit. You will write code to develop a demand function from two points. You will see how price affects the profit graph and how all of these equations relate to each other.  
* Demand and Revenue
* Business Applications of College Algebra: Extra

### Learn Simple and Compound Interest  
This unit will show you how to calculate interest, loan payments, and the estimated value of investments. You will see the math formula and turn that into code. Because these formulas tend to get complicated, you will appreciate having the code where you can just modify a few values.  
* Simple and Compound Interest
* Simple and Compound Interest: Extra

### Learn Exponents and Logarithms
